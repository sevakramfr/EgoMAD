We present two distinct sets of Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MSUDA) benchmarks for fine-grained egocentric action recognition. 

The benchmarks are useful for cross-domain and cross-dataset evaluation across a wide range of kitchen and daily living environments.

The dataset contains clips selected from EPIC-Kitchens, ADL, GTEA and Kitchen datasets.
