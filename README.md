# Egocentric Video Domain Adaptation

## Introduction
This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the MDDNet framework for UDA approach in fine-grained action recognition based on multiple datasets. The framework is experimented on publicly available UDA (EPIC-8 [1], ADL-7, and GTEA_KITCHEN-6[2]), and proposed MSUDA benchmarks.

The code and model will be available soon...
