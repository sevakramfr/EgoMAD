# Egocentric Video Domain Adaptation

## Introduction
This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the MDDNet framework for UDA approach in fine-grained action recognition based on multiple datasets. The framework is experimented on publicly available UDA (EPIC-8 [1], ADL-7, and GTEA_KITCHEN-6[2]), and proposed MSUDA benchmarks.

## Datasets
### EPIC-8
Download RGB frames from participants P01, P08 and P22 of the EPIC-KITCHENS-55 dataset, using official download script [Here](https://github.com/epic-kitchens/epic-kitchens-download-scripts)

The code and model will be available soon...
